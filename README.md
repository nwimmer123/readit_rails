## Synopsis ##

The purpose of Read It is for friends to be able to share book recommendations and discuss their favorite books in the reviews section.  Users can add any book they think their friends should read. Users can peruse the list of books recommended by their friends and if they would like more information, they can click on it to see more info. When they do so, they will also see reviews left by friends and they will be able to add their own reviews or discussion points.

## Motivation 

I have always wanted to have a way to discuss books and comics with my friends with whom I share similar reading tastes. I am also always seeking out good book recommendations from people I know. Many of my friends who meet these criteria live far away from me. Also, whenever I finish a book I have really enjoyed, I want to share it with others so that I can talk about the different plot points I found intriguing. Therefore, I wanted to make a site where I could do these things.  Once all the planned improvements are complete, then my vision will have been achieved.

## Future of the Site ##

There are many planned additions to this site.

### Social ###
* Login with Facebook.
* Invite friends to join.
* Have "reading buddies".
* Click on someone and see their profile.
* Get a notification when someone posts in a book you've posted or responds inside your thread.

### User Profile ###
* Currently reading tag, with the date that the reader is currently on.
* The currently reading book will be on the top of the profile.
* Allow users to upload avatar pictures that sit next to their reviews.

### Automated Book Info ###
* Entering many fields of info is annoying.
* When creating a new book entry, entering the title of the book will autopopulate the rest of the book fields. 

### Book rating system ###
* Users will be able to rank books. Each user will be allowed to rank a book once.
* The rank options will be:  Worst Ever, Bad, Ehhh, Good, GOAT.
* A detailed graph of all votes per category will be shown via a button click.

### Search Capability ###
* Users will be able to search the book recommendations by the different fields.

### Site Organization ###
* The default setting will be for the books to be displayed based on the date of submission, with the most recent submissions appearing on the top.
* Once a ratings system is in place, then the books will be ranked by highest rankings.

### Social Book Discussion ###
* Users will be able to notify their friends or just place a general notice that they are going to be reading a book starting on a certain date and invite others to also read the same book.
* Users will be able to have a discussion via the nested comments as they read the book.
* Users will decide if they want to get notifications about new discussion points being added to the board.
* Users will be able to set their discussion to public or private.
* If setting is public, anyone searching for an ongoing discussion group of the same book will be able to join it.
