## Synopsis ##

The purpose of Read It is for friends to be able to share book recommendations and discuss their favorite books in the reviews section.  Users can add any book they think their friends should read. Users can peruse the list of books recommended by their friends and if they would like more information, they can click on it to see more info. When they do so, they will also see reviews left by friends and they will be able to add their own reviews or discussion points.

## Motivation 

I have always wanted to have a way to discuss books and comics with my friends with whom I share similar reading tastes. I am also always seeking out good book recommendations from people I know. Many of my friends who meet these criteria live far away from me. Also, whenever I finish a book I have really enjoyed, I want to share it with others so that I can ta about the different plot points I found intriguing. Therefore, I wanted to make a site where I could do these things.  Once all the planned improvements are complete, then my vision will have been achieved.
